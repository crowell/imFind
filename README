DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN ABANDONED:
several group members didn't do parts, the final project doesn't fully work properly (memory leaks, can't be bothered to fix now)
I will upload later to just give latest code as an example for those wishing to do something similar. 

Android EC327 project
takes a picture, saves a bitmap to /sdcard/imFind.jpg
when you do recognize, the string that you input is saved to /sdcard/currentlearned.txt

recognize and learn not implemented.

GUI is finished, but can still be modified to do more things.
